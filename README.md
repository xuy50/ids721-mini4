## Create a Cargo Function microservice

1. Install Rust and Cargo
Rust is a programming language that Cargo, its package manager, uses. To install Rust and Cargo on Ubuntu, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
Copy code
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
This will download a script and start the installation. You'll need to follow the on-screen instructions.
```

2. Configure the Current Shell
After installation, configure your current shell by running:

```bash
Copy code
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

3. Create a New Cargo Project
To create a new Cargo project, use the cargo new command. For a microservice, you might want to start with a simple binary project:

```bash
Copy code
cargo new yx248-mini4 --bin
cd my_microservice
```

This command creates a new directory named my_microservice with the basic structure of a Rust project.
